      <h2>Understanding Pre-Rented Properties</h2>
      <p>Pre-rented properties, also known as pre-leased properties, are commercial or residential spaces that already have a tenant paying rent. When you buy the property, the lease agreement is transferred to you.</p>

      <h3>Benefits of Investing</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Immediate ROI:</strong> You start earning rental income from day one.</li>
        <li><strong>Zero Waiting Period:</strong> No need to spend months finding a suitable tenant.</li>
        <li><strong>Capital Appreciation:</strong> Along with regular income, the property value appreciates over time.</li>
      </ul>
